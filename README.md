# kivy-keytar
clone of piano tiles based on the kivy framework

i hated the update where the tiles must slide so much back in hs so i wrote it in lua

but now we here in the new age w my BOY python

conceptually the game is mad interesting and easy so i want to get good at it

improve reflexes or something


# controls
a, s, k, l

change'em in the GameScreen class's static variables if u want

# TODO
## many things, friend
+ add timer *done*

+ add win *done*

+ add lose message *done*

+ add replay *done*

idk sounds good to me
